# PONG GAME

I created this repo to help React beginners to create their own portfolio, so that they have something to show during an interview process.

I believe that programming is a craft, and that we only leverage our skills by programming.

## If you're a beginner

Don't see the code. 

Play the game and try to code it alone.

If you have doubts, then you can go and try to understad what I did. Reading other's code is also a skill that one must practice.

This challenge is inspired in the one freeCodeCamp proposes on their Interview Prep Certification.

User Story:
1. I can control a paddle
2. The computer can control the other paddle
3. The computer's paddle is unbeatable. It should never miss the ball
4. The game keeps track of the player and computer's score.

As the computer is unbeatable, I though point 4 isn't really important, so I added a few more user stories.

5. I have a score that increases every time I hit the ball
6. I have levels of difficulty. For each 10 hits, level increases by one, and the ball speed also increases turning it more difficult to play.

From this point beyond, I leave it up to you what to improve. Some ideas:
1. Improve CSS Layout
2. Improve Gamification
3. 2 Human Players
4. 4 Human Players (left, right, top, bottom)
5. Create a backend + database and keep user's scores
6. In case you did point 5 you can show the high-scores.

## The Stack
1. Vite React-TS app
2. TailwindCSS

## How to run the game locally

1. Fork the GitHub repo
2. Clone the GitHub repo to your local machine
3. cd into the pong-game folder
4. run yarn
5. run yarn dev
6. game will be available on http://localhost:5173
